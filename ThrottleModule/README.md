This is an android AIM Module (to be used in the Dodedodo framework, see www.dodedodo.com) which provides a throttle for string messages. Messages are not sent out faster than defined by the rate. Messages coming in between are discarded. It can be used in combination with other AIM modules.

It provides 1 input port and 1 output port.
