# ThrottleModule

This is an android AIM Module (to be used in the Dodedodo framework, see www.dodedodo.com) which provides a throttle for string messages. The incoming message stream is throttled such that messages on the outgoing stream are sent with the defined rate. To achieve that, the messages in between are dropped. The module can be used in combination with other AIM modules and is designed to throttle a video stream when sending it across devices.

It provides 1 input port and 1 output port.

The android module can be downloaded on the Google Play store [here]().
